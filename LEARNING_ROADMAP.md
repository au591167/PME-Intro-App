# React Native with Expo - Learning Roadmap

## üéØ Project Overview
You're working with a modern Expo React Native starter app that includes:
- File-based routing with Expo Router
- Cross-platform support (iOS, Android, Web)
- TypeScript for type safety
- Theming with light/dark mode
- Navigation with React Navigation
- Animations with react-native-reanimated

## üìö Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

#### Day 1-2: Setup & Exploration
- [ ] Run the project: `npm start`
- [ ] Explore the app on different platforms (iOS simulator, Android emulator, web)
- [ ] Understand the project structure:
  - `app/` directory for routing
  - `components/` for reusable UI
  - `assets/` for images and fonts
  - `hooks/` for custom React hooks

#### Day 3-4: Understanding Core Concepts
- [ ] Study file-based routing in `app/(tabs)/`
- [ ] Examine the layout structure in `app/_layout.tsx`
- [ ] Learn about theming in `hooks/useColorScheme.ts`
- [ ] Explore component structure in `components/`

### Phase 2: Hands-on Practice (Week 3-4)

#### Week 3: Component Development
- [ ] Create a new component in `components/`
- [ ] Add TypeScript types to components
- [ ] Practice using React Native's StyleSheet
- [ ] Learn about Flexbox layout system

#### Week 4: Navigation & Routing
- [ ] Add a new screen/tab to the app
- [ ] Implement navigation between screens
- [ ] Practice passing data between screens
- [ ] Learn about deep linking

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)

#### Week 5: State Management & API Integration
- [ ] Learn React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- [ ] Implement API calls with fetch/axios
- [ ] Practice form handling
- [ ] Learn about async storage

#### Week 6: Animations & Native Features
- [ ] Study the HelloWave animation component
- [ ] Implement your own animations
- [ ] Explore Expo SDK features (Camera, Location, etc.)
- [ ] Learn about platform-specific code

### Phase 4: Real Project (Week 7-8)

#### Week 7: Project Planning
- [ ] Brainstorm a simple app idea
- [ ] Plan the app structure
- [ ] Design the UI/UX
- [ ] Set up project architecture

#### Week 8: Implementation
- [ ] Build your first complete app
- [ ] Test on multiple platforms
- [ ] Deploy to Expo Go
- [ ] Get feedback and iterate

## üîÑ Weekly Review Process

1. **Monday**: Set weekly goals and review previous week
2. **Wednesday**: Mid-week progress check and troubleshooting
3. **Friday**: Complete weekly exercises and document learnings
4. **Sunday**: Review accomplishments and plan next week

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Start with Phase 1 exercises
2. Join the Expo community for support
3. Build small projects to practice each concept
4. Don't be afraid to experiment and break things!

Remember: The best way to learn is by doing. Start with small changes and gradually build more complex features.

Happy coding! üéâ
